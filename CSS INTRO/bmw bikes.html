      BMW S1000RR is a race oriented sport bike initially made by BMW Motorrad
      to compete in the 2009 Superbike World Championship,[1] that is now in
      commercial production. It was introduced in Munich in April 2008,[2] and
      is powered by a 999 cc (61.0 cu in) four-cylinder engine redlined at
      14,200 rpm.[3] BMW made 1,000 S1000RRs in 2009 to satisfy World Superbike
      homologation requirements, but expanded production for commercial sale of
      the bike in 2010. It has a standard anti-lock braking system, with an
      optional electronic traction control. As of 2016, it has a wet weight of
      204 kg (450 lb), and produces 148.4 kW (199.0 hp; 201.8 PS) at 13,500
      rpm.[4] With 133.6 kW (179.2 hp; 181.6 PS) to the rear wheel, it was the
      most powerful motorcycle in the class on the dyno.[5]Aside from power
      increase, the S1000RR's engine gains a weight loss of nearly 4 kg (9 lb)
      and a more compact external design. This was achieved through the use of
      specialized parts, like hollow-bored titanium intake valves and new DLC
      rocker arms that are said to be 25% lighter. The camshafts are now
      directly powered by the crankshaft, thus eliminating the need for the
      previous idler gear. The water and oil pumps are combined into one
      component for a compact design. The exhaust system is also 1.28 kg (2.8
      lb) lighter on the 2019 model, which contributes to a total 11 kg (24 lb)
      loss in comparison to its predecessor. This brings the overall curb weight
      of 197 kg (434 lb). To harness the power output, BMW gave the S1000RR a
      package of electronics suite of rider aids, including ABS Pro (cornering
      ABS), Dynamic Traction Control (DTC), Dynamic Traction Control Wheelie
      Function, Shift Assistant Pro (which allows for clutchless up and
      downshifts), Hill Start Control (HSC), Launch Control and Pit Lane
      Limiter. There are four preset riding modes: "Rain", "Road", "Dynamic" and
      "Race", as well as three "Pro" modes, which can be custom tuned and come
      with a three-stage engine-braking adjustment. The chassis has been
      revamped for the 2019 S1000RR, which is focusing on weight reduction while
      improving handling. The aluminium perimeter frame drops 1.28 kg (2.8 lb)
      of weight, now using the engine as more of a load-bearing unit and
      reducing width by 13 mm (0.51 in). With a focus on improving agility, BMW
      steepened the steering head angle to 66.9 degrees and reduced trail to
      93.9 mm (3.70 in). The wheelbase has been increased by 9 mm (0.35 in). The
      front suspension is a 45 mm (1.77 in) inverted telescopic fork, which is
      decreased in size from 46 mm (1.81 in), that is claimed to optimize flex
      and midcorner feel. BMW Dynamic Damping Control (DDC) semi-active
      suspension is still available on the S1000RR as an option, which has been
      enhanced with updated damping settings. The fuel tank and seat design are
      now slimmer. The front fairing is narrower and more aerodynamic than its
      predecessor, also housing twin symmetrical LED headlights, with the intake
      directly centered at the front for optimum airflow. The instrumentation
      now uses a 6.5-inch TFT display, which has four preset settings.

      an adventure touring motorcycle announced for the 2024 model year by BMW
      Motorrad, following the BMW R1250GS.[1] The engine and transmission were
      redesigned, as was the frame, eliminating the full trellis frame of the
      earlier model. Both changes contributed to a weight of 523 pounds (237
      kg), down 26 pounds (12 kg) from the previous model. It also eliminated
      the asymmetrical headlights in earlier generations of the GS series

      The BMW G 310 R is an entry-level standard motorcycle. It is BMW's first,
      modern, low-end, beginner motorcycle sold under the BMW Motorrad brand. It
      debuted in November 2015 with global sales beginning in 2018. The bike is
      powered by a four-valve 313 cc (19.1 cu in) liquid-cooled single-cylinder
      engine shared with the TVS Apache RR 310 that BMW says produces 25 kW
      (33.6 bhp) power at 9,500 rpm and 28 N⋅m (21 lbf⋅ft) torque at 7,500 rpm.
      The engine configuration has the intake in front of the engine, and the
      exhaust behind it.[1] BMW released the G 310 GS, an adventure bike based
      on the G 310 R, on July 19, 2018In 2013 BMW announced they were
      collaborating with motorcycle manufacturer TVS for production of a series
      of sub-500 cc bikes in Tamil Nadu.[4] These motorcycles were targeted for
      developing markets, markets with prominence of lower-displacement bikes,
      and as entry-level sport bikes in developed markets.[5] This was the first
      time that BMW Motorrad ventured into developing the sub-500 cc bikes.[6]
      BMW K03 was the code name given to the first collaborative product of
      BMW-TVS. It was a test bike which was developed in India and sent to
      Germany for further testing and modifications.[7] In October 2015 in
      Brazil, the BMW G 310 Stunt was the first concept bike unveiled by BMW
      Motorrad.[8] The commercial version of the concept was officially unveiled
      by BMW Motorrad the next month, at EICMA 2015 in Milan, Italy, and was
      shown in India at the 13th Auto Expo 2016.[9] The bike was commercially
      released on July 18 globally
